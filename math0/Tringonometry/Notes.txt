You can specify colors using a list you made or just use the premade list that I have
defined in the variables modules.
also you can use any mathematical function to, plot the points

example:

to plot: f(x) = 2x => y = 2x

then: 

x = [i for i in 100]
y = [i*2 for i in x]

and that plots 100 point.

More generalized description:
	=> f(x) = ax => y = ax {
		x = [i for i in 100]
		y = [i*a for i in x]
}
ploting the cos, sin, tan:
from math import TRIDFUNCNAME, radians
	=> sin(x) which is pre-defined. {
	x = [i for i in 100]
	y = [TRIGFUNCNAME(radians(i))]

	TRIGFUNCNAME -> it might be sin or tan or cos
}
